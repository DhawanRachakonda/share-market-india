## Important Points

 - APPSIL’s digital technologies to lead power grid transformation.
 - Bright ordering prospects from Transportation Infra, Data Centers, Renewables, Grid Automation & Smart Infra projects.
 - Targeting high growth in exports markets by leveraging low cost manufacturing base in India.
 - Focus on increasing sales contribution from digital services through OPEX driven demand generation.
 - Faster adoption of Electric Mobility along with charging infrastructure.
 - Being a leader in HVDC technology, APPSIL should benefit from opportunities for upgrades of maturing HVDC stations in the longer run.
 - ABB Power Grid is traditionally strong on the customer portfolio of utilities, industries, infrastructure and transportation while Hitachi is very strong on the mobility, smart city, energy storage, and on data Optimization/data center side. The combined offerings via APPSIL’s energy platform and Hitachi’s digital platform (LUMADA) can co-create innovative solutions for customers and partners across the value chain, right from the planning stage through the building phase, and into the operation phase, leveraging energy platforms, and focus on the intelligent grids.
 - Its revenue is expected to expand through (1) grid automation and modernisation, (2) electrification in rail, (3) expansion in metro projects, (4) rise of e-mobility, and (5) hypergrowth in data centers.
 - APPSIL has a dominant market share in many of the segments like data center, renewable, rail & metro. Its next competitor is having at least 10% lesser market share in respective segments. In case Power T&D segment, which is highly competitive, the Company has a decent double-digit market share. APPSIL is planning to increase its market share as it expects to receive preference as power equipment & system supplier in case of new projects
 - Estimated robust revenue growth of 14% CAGR over CY20-CY23E, driven by (1) a healthy order book of Rs. 48.0bn, (2) leveraging the parent’s presence at various global locations for boosting exports, (3) a good order inflow from rail and metro projects, (4) market share gain through their preferred supplier, and (5) growth in data centers.
 - Future energy solutions, electrification of rail, urban transport - metro rails, rising digitalisation and penetration of internet on the back of higher usage of social media, OTTs, IoT products that lead to need for massive data centers, rise of electric mobility and subsequent need for grid modernisation and use of smart grid.
 - APPSIL’s parent Hitachi has a legacy of innovation globally and can play a significant role in introducing innovative product lines that would give excellent technological and competitive advantage over peers.
 - The company is still using ABB’s IT infrastructure, and it is in a transition phase to build its own IT infrastructure, which can take at least three years. Thus, we can see higher other expenses on the IT side as it is implementing its ERP system.
 - The GoI has set a target of 450 GW of energy by 2030 through grid automation and modernisation, where the company can play a significant role. In India, ~50% of all HVDC links are commissioned by APPSIL. Once the situation is normalised, the company sees many opportunities due to India’s focus on “Make in India” and strengthening local ecosystems. These include industries like power transmission, rail, metro, e-mobility renewal integration, and data centers. APPSIL is betting big on the transition of energy and foresees substantial investment opportunities.
 - ABB Power Grid is traditionally strong on the customer portfolio of utilities, industries, infrastructure and transportation while Hitachi is very strong on the mobility, smart city, energy storage, and on data Optimization/data center side.
 - Electrification in railways may lead higher-order inflow for APPSIL.
 - Indian railways is marching towards its target of 100% electrification of the entire railway network by 2023 to reduce its operating cost, dependency on diesel, and carbon footprint. Management foresees relevant ordering opportunity size of Rs80bn over next 3 years via this initiative.
 - APPSIL is the preferred partner for Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL), bringing higher-order inflow for railway electrification projects. Indian railways has decided to replace the 2,700 diesel locomotives with electric locomotives in the next five years.
 - APPSIL is already a major supplier of these kinds of systems worldwide. We believe that APPSIL would get the sustainable business over the next 3-5 years as Indian railways move to procure electric locomotives.
 - Metro network expansion offers business opportunities. Over the next five years, metro rail of more than 1,500 km is likely to get commissioned at an estimated capex of Rs. 3 trillion.
 - APPSIL has provided electrification and power solutions to all operational metros in the country. It offers an opportunity to become a preferred choice of partner for future projects. 
 - All products of Hitachi ABB Power for metro projects are produced in India and suitable for local conditions.
 - The Indian Data Center industry is at the cusp of hyper-growth and can grow by 15x over the next decade. APPSIL has the unique ability to design, supply, and install the entire system from grid substations to the circuit breakers at the server, utilising the system and products.
 - For the rapidly growing data centre industry, APPSIL has introduced a purpose-built substation. The new smart substation is 30% smaller than traditional substations and uses fewer copper cables, thereby reducing the site construction time, installation costs, and risk.
 - The power grid is set to change significantly in the next 5-10 years, driven by an increase in demand for electricity with improvements in technology contributing to energy efficiency.
 - GoI has launched National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) to take this initiative forward on a fast-track basis.
 - Hitachi's IoT business has a turnover of ~ USD 20bn globally. The company has massive analytics and data capabilities to help customers across various industries. Considering Hitachi’s large installed base globally, APPSIL has a potential to achieve multifold growth in its services business by offering a cost efficient option.
 - The rise of EVs and high degree of adoption of electric mobility may require change and modernisation of infrastructure such as ports and roadways. The adoption of EVs can address pollution as well.
 -  APPSIL has already captured this opportunity and set up pilot  ABB Power Products and Systems 12 projects with industry and academic institutions to increase the ecosystem for efficient and greener electric mobility (electric bus).
 -  APPSIL’s TOSHA, a flash charging system, quickly tops up the battery while passengers get on and off the bus. The rise and adoption of e-mobility space may require infrastructure in the form of grid upgradation, charging stations, and technology to provide business opportunities and drive the order inflow for APPSIL.

## Business Impact

 - A slowdown in capex on infrastructure and utilities from GOI.
 - Increase in material prices.
 - Delay in project execution and getting orders.
 - Aggressive pricing strategies in case of the large projects can impact profitability.
