across the value chain and emerging areas like e-mobility, smart cities, energy storage, and data centers. With a proven track record, global
footprint, and unparalleled installed base, Hitachi ABB Power Grids balance social, environmental, and economic values. It is committed to
powering well for a sustainable energy future, with pioneering and digital technologies, as the partner of choice for enabling a more robust,
smarter, and greener grid.</p>
<p>APPSIL - post its demerger from ABB India Ltd. - was incorporated in Feb 2019. In December 2018, ABB Ltd announced the divestment of its
global power grids business unit into a JV, where Hitachi would be the majority shareholder with 80.1%. APPSIL has 16 manufacturing
facilities at five locations, with 17 sales offices, 2,200+ employees and a 1,000+ client base.
ABB Power Product and System India Ltd (APPSIL) is a well-known and established global player in various utilities and industries, including
companies operating in industries like railways, oil & gas, IT, and electric power companies. APPSIL operates in four segments:
  <ol>
  <li>Grid automation: Hitachi Power Grids provide a protection control and remote monitoring control system to realise grid network
stabilisation, and management system for supply and demand of electricity market for trading.</li>
<li>Grid integration: Provides grid integration portfolio that spans a wide range of transmission and substation applications, facilitating reliable
and efficient system integration of the future digital electric network with minimum environmental impact. It incorporates the integrated
systems, solutions, and services of its business’ DC and AC fields, including HVDC, substations, FACTS, Offshore Wind Connections,
Semiconductors, and Power Consulting, for utility and industrial grid applications as well as e-transportation solutions.</li>
<li>High voltage products: Offering a wide range of high-voltage products up to 1,200-kilovolt (kV) and help to amend the safety, reliability, and
efficiency of power networks while minimising the environmental impact. The company’s technology leadership continues to facilitate
innovations in areas such as ultra-high-voltage power transmission, enabling smart grids and enhancing eco-efficiency.</li>
<li>Transformers: Through its innovative and diverse transformers’ team and pioneering technology, it provides power, distribution, and
transaction transformers for railways.</li>

## Important Points

 - Its revenue is expected to expand through (1) grid automation and modernisation, (2) electrification in rail, (3) expansion in metro projects, (4) rise of e-mobility, and (5) hypergrowth in data centers.
 - Estimated robust revenue growth of 14% CAGR over CY20-CY23E, driven by (1) a healthy order book of Rs. 48.0bn, (2) leveraging the parent’s presence at various global locations for boosting exports, (3) a good order inflow from rail and metro projects, (4) market share gain through their preferred supplier, and (5) growth in data centers.
 - Future energy solutions, electrification of rail, urban transport - metro rails, rising digitalisation and penetration of internet on the back of higher usage of social media, OTTs, IoT products that lead to need for massive data centers, rise of electric mobility and subsequent need for grid modernisation and use of smart grid.
 - APPSIL’s parent Hitachi has a legacy of innovation globally and can play a significant role in introducing innovative product lines that would give excellent technological and competitive advantage over peers.
 - The company is still using ABB’s IT infrastructure, and it is in a transition phase to build its own IT infrastructure, which can take at least three years. Thus, we can see higher other expenses on the IT side as it is implementing its ERP system.
 - The GoI has set a target of 450 GW of energy by 2030 through grid automation and modernisation, where the company can play a significant role. In India, ~50% of all HVDC links are commissioned by APPSIL. Once the situation is normalised, the company sees many opportunities due to India’s focus on “Make in India” and strengthening local ecosystems. These include industries like power transmission, rail, metro, e-mobility renewal integration, and data centers. APPSIL is betting big on the transition of energy and foresees substantial investment opportunities.
 - Electrification in railways may lead higher-order inflow for APPSIL.
 - Indian railways is marching towards its target of 100% electrification of the entire railway network by 2023 to reduce its operating cost, dependency on diesel, and carbon footprint.
 - APPSIL is the preferred partner for Power Grid Corporation of India (PGCIL), bringing higher-order inflow for railway electrification projects. Indian railways has decided to replace the 2,700 diesel locomotives with electric locomotives in the next five years.
 - APPSIL is already a major supplier of these kinds of systems worldwide. We believe that APPSIL would get the sustainable business over the next 3-5 years as Indian railways move to procure electric locomotives.
 - Metro network expansion offers business opportunities. Over the next five years, metro rail of more than 1,500 km is likely to get commissioned at an estimated capex of Rs. 3 trillion.
 - APPSIL has provided electrification and power solutions to all operational metros in the country. It offers an opportunity to become a preferred choice of partner for future projects. 
 - All products of Hitachi ABB Power for metro projects are produced in India and suitable for local conditions.
 - The Indian Data Center industry is at the cusp of hyper-growth and can grow by 15x over the next decade. APPSIL has the unique ability to design, supply, and install the entire system from grid substations to the circuit breakers at the server, utilising the system and products.
 - For the rapidly growing data centre industry, APPSIL has introduced a purpose-built substation. The new smart substation is 30% smaller than traditional substations and uses fewer copper cables, thereby reducing the site construction time, installation costs, and risk.
 - The power grid is set to change significantly in the next 5-10 years, driven by an increase in demand for electricity with improvements in technology contributing to energy efficiency.
 - GoI has launched National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) to take this initiative forward on a fast-track basis.
 - Hitachi's IoT business has a turnover of ~ USD 20bn globally. The company has massive analytics and data capabilities to help customers across various industries. Considering Hitachi’s large installed base globally, APPSIL has a potential to achieve multifold growth in its services business by offering a cost efficient option.
 - The rise of EVs and high degree of adoption of electric mobility may require change and modernisation of infrastructure such as ports and roadways. The adoption of EVs can address pollution as well.
 -  APPSIL has already captured this opportunity and set up pilot  ABB Power Products and Systems 12 projects with industry and academic institutions to increase the ecosystem for efficient and greener electric mobility (electric bus).
 -  APPSIL’s TOSHA, a flash charging system, quickly tops up the battery while passengers get on and off the bus. The rise and adoption of e-mobility space may require infrastructure in the form of grid upgradation, charging stations, and technology to provide business opportunities and drive the order inflow for APPSIL.
